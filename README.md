## Game Overview

In **Skeleton Hero Defense**, you control a skeleton warrior who must defend against oncoming wolves and ghosts, which are attacking from the right side of the screen. Armed with a limited supply of bones and powerful skulls, your goal is to stop the enemies from reaching your position.

You will win the game by defeating 50 enemies. However, you lose if any of the enemies touch you, or if 3 or more enemies manage to pass by without being stopped.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Main Hero (Skeleton)**: The player controls a skeleton who throws bones and uses skulls as weapons.
  
- **Weapons**:
  - **Bones**: Your main weapon. A bone kills only one enemy it touches. You start with 5 bones, and an additional bone is added to your supply every 3 seconds. Use them wisely!
  - **Skulls (Super-Weapon)**: Skulls are special items that kill all enemies on the current line when used. You can pick up skulls from fallen enemies and deploy them strategically.

- **Enemies**:
  - **Wolves**: Fast-moving enemies that charge towards you.
  - **Ghosts**: Slightly slower than wolves but trickier to deal with.
